firefly
=======

Firefly is a fork from  Cornell Spider created at UIUC for the Illinois Social Security Number remediation project.

Firefly's user interface is drastically simplified, centered around two simple 'play' and 'pause' buttons. This allowed us to deploy Firefly for use by most campus users with minimal assistance from IT professional staff.

The Firefly source code has not been updated since 2007, and so may not be compatible with modern Windows systems.

Questions
-------------
As the original developer from UIUC, and would be glad to answer any questions from other schools considering Firefly or Cornell Spider for their own SSN remediation efforts.
