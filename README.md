A fork from  Cornell Spider created at UIUC for the Illinois Social Security Number remediation project.

This code has not been updated since 2007.

Collaboration

I'm the original developer from UIUC, and would be glad to answer any questions from other schools considering Firefly or Cornell Spider for their own SSN remediation efforts.
